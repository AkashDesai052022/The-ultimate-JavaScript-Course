console.log("Variables in JavaScript");

console.log("this is video no. 2");
// that's why JS is dynamically typed language
// JS is allowed to change variable type in runtime
let a = 67;
console.log(a);
a = "harry"  // here we can redeclare variable and also reassign the value to it
console.log(a);

var $a = 7;
var _a = 7;


// var 8a = 7; // this is not allowed 
// var var = 7;  // this is also not allowed to declare varibles with reserved words 

var Harry = "Harry"
var harry = "harry"
var haRRy = "haRRy"
// that's why JavaScript is case Sensitive 
// but don't do this because your code is should readable , that shoyld be your first priority
